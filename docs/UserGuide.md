TechConnect is a **desktop app for managing internship applications, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for TechConnect.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g., typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    - `list` : Lists all companies.

    - `add n/Google p/98765432 e/google@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 cp/www.google-career-url.com` : Adds a company named `Google` to the Address Book.

    - `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd company shown in the current list.

    - `clear` : Deletes all companies.

    - `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g., in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Google`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g., `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Google t/bigTech` or as `n/Google`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g., `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e., 0 times), `t/bigTech`, `t/bigTech t/BigCompany` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g., if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g., if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

TechConnect data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TechConnect data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, TechConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TechConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

---

## FAQ
**Q**: What platforms can TechConnect support?<br>
**A**: TechConnect is able to run on Windows, macOS and Linux environments. Please ensure that you have `Java 17` installed as stated in [Quick Start](#quick-start).

**Q**: Why is there data when I did not add any data when I launched the application?<br>
**A**: The data in TechConnect is sample data that already exists. The purpose is to allow users to try out the features of TechConnect based on sample data. To work on a fresh copy, simply use the `clear` command.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TechConnect home folder.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
